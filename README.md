## Hi there, I am Anderson Contreira ðŸ‘‹

I am a Solutions and Software Architect with 6 years of team management experience in agile environments. 
With a background in IT since 2008, I bring cloud expertise in AWS (7 years) and Google Cloud (1 year), along with 
extensive development experience in PHP (15 years), JavaScript (15 years), Node.js (7 years), Python (5 years), 
Java (6 years), and TypeScript (4 years). I am eager to contribute to a company involved in international projects, 
helping it scale and solve complex challenges.

I have led the development of technical solutions, collaborating with PMs and POs to deliver technology products 
aligned with business needs. I have also guided the transition of legacy services to microservices for improved 
scalability and performance. Additionally, I trained teams on software engineering best practices, 
conducted research on new technologies, and led system architecture evolutions into distributed architectures while 
fostering a DevOps culture.

I am proficient in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and passionate for learning and sharing knowledge. 
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I am currently working as a Senior full stack Software Engineer at [Rocket Lawyer](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/).
